# Flashcard Game
## CPSC 210 Project 

###Project Proposal:
- **What will the application do?**
  - This application will be used to create and study sets 
  of flashcards which consist of a question/ statement and 
  an answer. They can be studied through the use of fill in the answer
  style questions. Users will be able to study from 
  questions they previously got wrong, and their progress
  through the set (number of questions correctly answered) will be recorded.
- **Who will use it?**
  - This application is mostly targeted at university or high school
  students to aid in studying for exams. However, it can be used
  by anyone as a memorization tool.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  - As a person studying Biology in addition to Computer Science
  I find flash cards the best way to memorise terminology. Being
  able to test my recall with questions helps a lot with remembering
  everything.
